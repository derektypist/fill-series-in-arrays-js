# Fill Series in Arrays (JavaScript)

The purpose of this exercise is to perform fill series in Arrays without having to use loops.  For example, the square of numbers.

## UX

As a user, I expect to see the arrays of natural numbers, square numbers, cube numbers, random numbers, arithmetic progression, geometric progression, first 10 letters of alphabet, multiples of 3 or 5 (boolean and number).

## Features

Allows the user to view numbers in array form.

## Technologies

Uses HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and Google Fonts.

## Testing

Ensure user stories have been carried out.

## Deployment

Deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://derektypist.github.io/fill-series-in-arrays-js) at the main branch.
